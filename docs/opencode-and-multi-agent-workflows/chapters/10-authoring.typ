  #numbered(
    [*Single purpose.* A persona that does two things does
     neither well, and the router can't pick it confidently.],
    [*Description = router prompt.* Optimize it for matching,
     not for the human reader of the file.],
    [*Restrict tools.* `edit: deny` for anyone who critiques.
     `bash: ask` is a safe default for anyone non-trivial.],
    [*Pin a model only with a reason.* The default is the cheap
     model; bumping it should cite the escalation trigger.],
    [*Pin a return shape.* A persona without an output format
     leaks prose; the caller can't act on it programmatically.],

    [*How you work* --- process notes, references to the
     project's `AGENTS.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / CI scripts.],

     in its lane under pressure.],
